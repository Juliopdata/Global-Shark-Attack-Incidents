Data complied by the global shark attacks file</p>

## Overview

The goal of this project is to combine everything I have learned about data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation with Pandas so I can see how it all works together. For this project, I start with a messy data set Shark Attack. I need to import it, use my data wrangling skills to clean it up, prepare it to be analyzed, and then export it as a clean CSV data file.

## Hypothesis

**Are USA citizens the favourite food of de common shark?**
